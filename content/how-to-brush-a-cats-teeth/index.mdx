-   Detailed steps on how to brush a cat's teeth effectively

**Is it Necessary to Brush a Cat's Teeth?**

Yes, it is crucial.

More than 85% of cats over three years old suffer from periodontal disease, leading to tooth pain, difficulty chewing, appetite loss, and potentially other health complications.

While cats between 1-2 years may not require daily teeth brushing, they become increasingly at risk for dental issues like calculus, stomatitis, and infections impacting the heart and liver as they age. Introducing a teeth-brushing routine early, around 2 months old, is advised. Note that while dental snacks and specific cat foods claim to improve oral health, they cannot substitute for brushing.

**Choosing the Right Toothbrush and Toothpaste for Cats**

1.  **Toothbrush Options:**

    -   Baby toothbrushes, finger brushes, and cat-specific toothbrushes are all suitable. For small feline teeth, baby toothbrushes with a single bristle bundle work well. In their absence, clean gauze can replace finger brushes.

2.  **Toothpaste:**

    -   Human toothpaste is unsafe for cats. Opt for vet-approved toothpaste, which doesn't require rinsing and is safe for cats to swallow.

**Recommended Frequency:** Daily is ideal, but aim for at least twice a week.

**How to Brush Your Cat’s Teeth**

**Duration:** Each session should be 30 seconds to 1 minute.

**What To Do:**

1.  First, gently calm your cat.
2.  Brush their teeth over the bathroom sink.
3.  Wet the toothbrush and put on cat toothpaste. You can use juice from canned cat food to make it taste better.
4.  Gently hold your cat’s head, lift up the corners of their mouth to show the teeth, and start brushing.
5.  Brush in circles or up-and-down strokes. Don’t brush side-to-side or stick the brush straight into their mouth.
6.  When done, give them a treat or play with them so they connect brushing with good things.

**Other Helpful Tips:**

-   Always give them praise and a treat after brushing.
-   Expect them to resist at first and maybe bleed a little from the gums.
-   You can start getting kittens used to brushing at 3 months old.
-   4-5 month old kittens may lose some baby teeth during brushing, which is normal.
-   If your cat really hates it, don’t force them, or they’ll hate it more.
-   For cats that hate brushing, try short sessions.
-   Regularly lift their lips so they get used to that feeling.

By following these guidelines, you can maintain your cat's dental health and prevent common dental issues.
