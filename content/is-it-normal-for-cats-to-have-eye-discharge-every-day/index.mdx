As a cat owner, you might have noticed that your furry friend sometimes has gunk in the corners of their eyes. This is called eye discharge, and it's actually pretty common.

### 1.Is it normal for cats to have eye gunk every day?

Yes, it is.

Just like humans, cats commonly experience various degrees of eye discharge. This discharge often mixes with airborne dust and dries, forming crusts that can be gently removed with a moist towel, tissue, or cotton swab.

Normally, a healthy cat's eye discharge is very small, no bigger than a small mung bean. It is clear or white when wet, and turns dark brown or black when it dries. For healthy cats, this dried discharge is not a problem. It usually flakes off easily, and cats often clean it themselves when they groom. However, if the discharge is bigger than a small mung bean, it needs attention.

If your cat has really sticky eye gunk, puffy eyelids, red eyes, or these eye problems plus coughing, sneezing, not eating, or acting tired, take them to the vet right away. Also, don't give your cat any medicine unless your vet says it's okay.

1.  **If your cat has brown, dark brown, or reddish brown eye discharge that's pretty dry:**

    -   Possible Cause: Eating too much food high in fat/oil/salt or not drinking enough water
    -   What To Do: Switch them to a balanced cat food, give vitamins, and make sure they have enough clean water in multiple places.

1.  **If the eye discharge is yellow:**

    -   Possible Cause: Eye inflammation or infection
    -   What To Do: Use special cat eye drops/ointment (erythromycin, chlortetracycline, or norfloxacin) if your vet says it's okay (for cats over 6 months old).

1.  **If the eye discharge is pink/dark red with blood vessels in it:**

    -   Possible Cause: Injury to the eye
    -   What To Do: Take them to the vet right away.

1.  **If the eye discharge is green-yellow, sticky, smells bad, and the cat has eye tears:**

    -   Possible Cause: Tear duct infection
    -   What To Do: Take them to the vet to get chloramphenicol drops/ointment.

1.  **If eye discharge comes with tears and the clear part of the eye starts getting cloudy:**

    -   Possible Cause: Eyelashes rubbing the eye
